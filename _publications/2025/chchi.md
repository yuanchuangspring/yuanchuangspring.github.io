abstract: >-
  In recent years, China has made notable progress in the digital transformation of its service sector; however, rural regions continue to face substantial challenges in this domain. Government cadres and residents of rural communities, particularly older adults, often have difficulties in adopting and using digital technologies. To address these challenges, this study has developed a smartphone-based digital tool that utilizes the device’s camera to capture, recognize, and organize textual or image information, which is subsequently uploaded to the system. This methodology improves the efficiency of administrative tasks and facilitates the submission of digital information by older adults. The study concentrates on the digital design of grassroots governance services in rural areas, emphasizing existing challenges and providing practical solutions and design recommendations to advance digital development in rural communities.
