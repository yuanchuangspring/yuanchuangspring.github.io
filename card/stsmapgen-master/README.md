## Theory

1. Set the start point and the end point.
2. Prepare points with Poisson disk sampling.
3. Generate links with Delaunay triangulation.
4. Find the path from the start point to the end point with A*.
5. Exclude random points on the path.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 several times.
7. Complete!
